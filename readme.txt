--Readme document for Yovan Theophilus--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

But I expect a 15% decrease since I'm submitting it late.

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    I included navigation links, where the website visitors can navigate through 3 different pages, the homepage, resume, and contact info page.
    Furthermore, I also include a hero section on the homepage to introduce myself and also image on contact info page.
    I also include footer to show the creater of the website and also my linkedin profile link.


(b) CSS features
    I use hover effect on the navigation menu so that when the mouse point to the button, it will change the color a bit, marking that the button is clickable.
    I also styles to ensure there are padding between texts and also flexible body layout so that it can adapt to various screen sizes.


(c) Advanced features
    I include navigation bar to navigate between pages.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    It took me around 2 days to complete this assignment


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
    I got help from a Youtube video, where it shows the general way of creating personal portfolio using HTML. The link to the YouTube video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YFrGy_mzjY
    I also accessed a website to help with formatting issues, https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-make-a-navigation-bar-in-html
    The rest, I just use materials provided by the class, such as lecture slides and demo code
